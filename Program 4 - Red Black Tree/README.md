# Red Black Tree

1. Implement the tree as a template, to support multiple data types
2. Get timings for lookups with 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, and 1000000 million items. 
3. Compare this to an unsorted linked list (linear search)
4. Perform insertion and find
5. Override the necessary comparison operators to allow to do checks (< and = can suffice)
6. Create a recursive function to check if the tree has the same number of black nodes along each simple path (black height)
7. Implement nil nodes to simplify your code
